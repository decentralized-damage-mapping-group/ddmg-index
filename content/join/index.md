## Getting started

<br>  

```bash
pip install canopy
```

```r
install.packages("canopy")
```		


Those don't actually work, but they illustrate a key aspiration of canopy.coop: _starting a consulting practice should be as easy as installing a Python or R package._

## Cooperative benefits

Thanks for being here. Our mission at canopy.coop is to make it extremely easy for experts to start consulting. That looks like going from ground zero to having a legal business in 3 days. That includes:  

- üìù __insurance__ : commercial, professional, and general liability  
- üôã __mentorship__ : help marketing and scoping professional work  
- üíµ __finances__ : bank account, invoicing templates, taxes  
- ‚úâÔ∏è __communication and data__ : email and drive storage  
- üï∏Ô∏è __network__: colleagues to collaborate with
- üñ•Ô∏è __branding__ : website and marketing 
- ‚öñÔ∏è __legal__ : counsel and legal forms
