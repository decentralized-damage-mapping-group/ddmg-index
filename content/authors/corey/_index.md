I develop methods in satellite remote sensing to study terrestrial hydrologic processes and associated human impacts. Where earth science and geopolitics overlay, I develop insights from remote sensing observations that support scientific research in terrestrial hydrology and diplomatic accountability in the monitoring and management of increasingly scarce freshwater resources.
